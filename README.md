### About me:

I started my journey in the IT industry at the age of 11 (I'm now 16) and have been tirelessly improving my skills ever since. In 5 years I have learned many languages and technologies including Python, C#, C, Bash, Lua, JavaScript and of course my favorite Golang.

Currently, I am most interested in backend development and am constantly working to expand my knowledge and practical skills in this area. I am passionate about building efficient and reliable server-side applications that keep interactive products running smoothly.

On my GitHub profile, you will find examples of my projects that demonstrate my skills with various technologies. I am always open to new learning and development opportunities, so feel free to contact me if you have interesting suggestions or ideas.

I would also like to invite you to join me on Telegram, where I share my thoughts, victories and failures: &nbsp;  [![Telegram Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Telegram-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=telegram&logoColor=white)](https://t.me/grudwald_blog)
